##Add a new database
Clicking **ADD NEW DATABASE** you will be redirected to another page and you can add a new database. In this page you will see a form in which you can specify the configuration of your database. The required fields are the *Name* (1), *Host* (2), *Port* (3), *Username* (4) and *Password* (5). The first three fields are about the database and the last two are about the user used to read the data from the database. The user can be a read only user. Infact a MaaS user can only view the data of a company database. Data writing is not allowed. Finally, click on the **ADD DATABASE** button (6).
